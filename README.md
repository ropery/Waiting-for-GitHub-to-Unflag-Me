2022-06-18: I finally got a reply from GitHub Support to my ticket asking that
my account be un-flagged. My account is still flagged, for how much longer I
can't guess.

Methinks my account was either reported by some goody-two-shoes woke asshole,
or was picked off in the sweep of an update to GitHub's algorithm.

So, a recap of what happened. At the end of March, a banner appeared on GitHub
saying my account had been flagged, with *no explanation* whatsoever what for.
I filed a ticket immediately. Weeks passed and zero reply. As I waited I
opened, intermittently, several more tickets for the same request to un-flag,
in case the older tickets fell through ignored. After nearly *three months*,
GitHub Support sent me a reply, enlightening me why they immured my account in
solitary confinement for the duration (for being flagged means your account
virtually disappears from GitHub, all links to your account or repositories
returning 404, all your issues, comments and whatnot, hidden from everyone.)

Guess what sin I committed? My username was *WRONG*!<br>
Here is the reply that took GitHub three months to send:

My username! Which I have used since I registered at GitHub in 2009! Now it's
suddenly offensive, obscene, unacceptable, must be changed.

I will forbear discussing the nature of my username (which besides I made up
casually, years ago, on a rhythmical pattern) or the justice of forbidding it.
Suffice it to say, I disagree with the accusation and the verdict.

So like the powerless pissant I am, I went to the account settings page to
change my username. Guess what again? The "Change username" button is grayed
out: "Please contact us if you'd like to rename your account."

Goodness! Shall I go through that again, and wait another three months?
