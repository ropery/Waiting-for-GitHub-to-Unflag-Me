**2022-03-30**: GitHub flagged my account:

> **Your account has been flagged.**<br>
> Because of that, your profile is hidden from the public. If you believe this
> is a mistake, [contact support](https://github.com/contact) to have your
> account status reviewed.

**2022-06-18**: I finally got a reply from GitHub Support to my ticket asking that
my account be un-flagged. My account is still flagged, for how much longer I
can't guess.

Methinks my account was either reported by some goody-two-shoes woke asshole,
or was picked off in the sweep of an update to GitHub's algorithm.

So, a recap of what happened. At the end of March, a banner appeared on GitHub
saying my account had been flagged, with *no explanation* whatsoever what for.
I filed a ticket immediately. Weeks passed and zero reply. As I waited I
opened, intermittently, several more tickets for the same request to un-flag,
in case the older tickets fell through ignored. After nearly *three months*,
GitHub Support sent me a reply, enlightening me why they immured my account in
solitary confinement for the duration (for being flagged means your account
virtually disappears from GitHub, all links to your account or repositories
returning 404, all your issues, comments and whatnot, hidden from everyone.)

Guess what sin I committed? My username was *WRONG*!<br>
Here is the reply that took GitHub three months to send:

My username! Which I have used since I registered at GitHub in 2009! Now it's
suddenly offensive, obscene, unacceptable, must be changed.

I will forbear discussing the nature of my username (which besides I made up
casually, years ago, on a rhythmical pattern) or the justice of forbidding it.
Suffice it to say, I disagree with the accusation and the verdict.

So like the powerless pissant I am, I went to the account settings page to
change my username. Guess what again? The "Change username" button is grayed
out: "Please contact us if you'd like to rename your account."

Goodness! Shall I go through that again, and wait another three months?

**2022-06-19**: I had my username changed, account un-flagged. I'm now @ropery,
(which is a cooler name; I mean I could have asked for @gigogigolo or
@dildodildolong for continuity and shits and giggles, but would it have been
accepted? And in this climate, why risk it?)

Fortunately, GitHub Support replied to my follow-up question in the original
ticket, offering to assist me in changing my username without my having to open
a separate ticket. (You more often get pleasantly surprised if you set your
expectations low, natch.)

The renaming of account took eight hours after I sent my request.

@lolilolicon is dead; hang on @loli, @lolita, and especially @lolicon (Pray,
motherfucker!) Now it's clear, given the survivors, some bluenose yellow
back-stabber reported on me. Who among you cowards reported on meâ€½ A pox on
that roperipe! And this woke-ity-woke bullshit? It's a shame.

And shame on GitHub for their inhuman tardiness. They obviously need to hire
more people to do support. But in this particular case, the whole thing could
have been automated: so they decide my username is a violation, cool whatever,
just tell me that immediately after (or better, before!) flagging my account,
giving me a way to DIY-change my username, upon which my account is un-flagged
automatically. What actually happened, the whole thing was stupid, and shows
GitHub up for the lumbering fritzy bureaucracy it's become. Shame.
